On **June 26, 2025**, [OTel Community Day and Open Observability Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-observability-summit-otel-community-day/) are joining forces at [Open Source Summit North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/). The OpenTelemetry governance and technical committees, along with project maintainers, are excited to present two community-led tracks, one co-located event, and a shared goal: bring the observability community together to collaborate, learn, and shape the future of open source observability.

 **Open Observability Summit** is for developers, operators, and technical leaders who rely on open source to gain deeper insight into their systems. Every session is grounded in real-world experience and shaped by the community. Expect hands-on learning, practical talks, and open dialogue.

 **OTel Community Day** is a space for the OpenTelemetry community—maintainers, contributors, and users—to celebrate wins, share knowledge, and connect over where observability is headed. Whether you’re building OTel or building with it, you’ll find your people here.
