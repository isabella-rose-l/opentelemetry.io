On **June 26, 2025**,
[OTel Community Day and Open Observability Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-observability-summit-otel-community-day/)
are joining forces at
[Open Source Summit North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/).
The OpenTelemetry governance and technical committees, along with project
maintainers, are excited to present two community-led tracks, one co-located
event, and a shared goal: bring the observability community together to
collaborate, learn, and shape the future of open source observability.

**Open Observability Summit** is for developers, operators, and technical
leaders who rely on open source to gain deeper insight into their systems. Every
session is grounded in real-world experience and shaped by the community. Expect
hands-on learning, practical talks, and open dialogue.

**OTel Community Day** is a space for the OpenTelemetry community to celebrate
wins, share knowledge, and connect over where observability is headed. Our
[contributor experience survey results](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2025/contribex-survey-results/)
show that OTel contributors are excited to collaborate in person, where they can
not only learn from each other and but also help end users with practical
insights and real-world examples. Whether you're building OTel or building with
it, you'll find your people here.
